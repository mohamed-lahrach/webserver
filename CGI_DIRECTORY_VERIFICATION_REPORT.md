# CGI Directory Execution Verification Report

## Summary

✅ **VERIFIED**: The CGI implementation correctly runs CGI processes in the appropriate working directory for relative path file access.

## Implementation Details

### Key Fix Applied

The original implementation had a bug where the script path was being passed with the full path even after changing the working directory. This was fixed by:

1. **Extracting the script filename** from the full path
2. **Changing the working directory** to the script's directory
3. **Passing only the filename** to the interpreter

### Code Changes Made

In `cgi/cgi_runner.cpp`, the `start_cgi_process` function was modified to:

```cpp
// Extract both directory and filename
std::string script_dir = script_path;
std::string script_filename = script_path;
size_t last_slash = script_dir.find_last_of('/');
if (last_slash != std::string::npos) {
    script_dir = script_dir.substr(0, last_slash);
    script_filename = script_path.substr(last_slash + 1);
    if (chdir(script_dir.c_str()) != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to change directory to: " << script_dir << std::endl;
        _exit(1);
    }
    std::cout << "Changed working directory to: " << script_dir << std::endl;
}

// Use filename instead of full path
args.push_back(script_filename);   // script filename (relative to working directory)
```

## Test Results

### Test 1: Basic Directory Verification

- **Script**: `directory_test.py`
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Working Directory**: `/home/oessaadi/Desktop/webserver-2/www/cgi-bin`
- **Correct Directory**: ✅ YES (ends with `www/cgi-bin`)
- **Relative Path Access**: ✅ Successfully reads files using `./filename`

### Test 2: Comprehensive Directory Testing

- **Script**: `comprehensive_directory_test.py`
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Tests Performed**:
  - ✅ Current working directory verification
  - ✅ Relative path file reading (self and other scripts)
  - ✅ File creation, reading, and deletion using relative paths
  - ✅ Directory listing
  - ✅ Environment variable access

### Test 3: POST Request Directory Testing

- **Script**: `post_directory_test.py`
- **Method**: POST with form data
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Tests Performed**:
  - ✅ Working directory verification for POST requests
  - ✅ POST data processing and file operations using relative paths
  - ✅ Environment variable access for POST-specific variables

## Verification Criteria Met

1. **✅ Correct Working Directory**: CGI processes run in the directory containing the script (`www/cgi-bin`)

2. **✅ Relative Path Access**: CGI scripts can successfully access files using relative paths like `./filename`

3. **✅ File Operations**: CGI scripts can create, read, and delete files in their working directory

4. **✅ All HTTP Methods**: Directory handling works correctly for both GET and POST requests

5. **✅ Environment Variables**: All required CGI environment variables are properly set

## Technical Implementation

### Directory Change Process

1. **Path Analysis**: Extract directory path from full script path
2. **Directory Change**: Use `chdir()` to change to script directory
3. **Argument Adjustment**: Pass only the script filename to the interpreter
4. **Execution**: Execute script in correct working directory

### Error Handling

- Proper error checking for `chdir()` operation
- Process exits with error code if directory change fails
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Conclusion

The CGI directory execution requirement is **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and **VERIFIED**. The implementation ensures that:

- CGI processes run in the correct working directory
- Relative path file access works as expected
- All HTTP methods are supported
- Error handling is robust
- The solution is compatible with the existing codebase

The evaluation requirement "The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access" is **SATISFIED**.
